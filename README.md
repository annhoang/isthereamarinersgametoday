Big credit and thanks to Laura Forrest and William Reynolds, the original creators of the site "Is There a Giants Game Today?".

I used their GitHub project as a starting point and, being a lifelong Seattle Mariners fan, updated it for the M's.

Feel free to fork this project on GitHub. Mobile apps coming soon.
